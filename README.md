### A simple Minesweeper clone made in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/)

- Click to uncover tiles
- Right click to flag them as mines
- When you die, press R to restart

## Compiling
Make sure odin is in your path and run `odin run src`. If you're compiling on windows you'll need to add `SDL2.dll`, `SDL2_ttf.dll` and `zlib1.dll` to the Minesweeper directory for it to run successfully
